In this file, we will keep track of the different community tasks performed for the oss.gg community.

This serves a few purposes:

1. We can handle points awarding via a MERGE
2. We document the work we do for new people to join
3. Non technical people get familiarized with how Git works

At a later stage we will make this available either on oss.gg or the oss.gg app.

For now, it's a simple txt file :)

Setup Discord channels 
-------------------   
The purpose 
1. To help organize members within the OSS server based on their roles, responsibilities, or permissions. For example, we have Designers, PMs and engineers. This makes it easier to manage and interact with different groups of users.
2. The roles can help identify members with specific roles or expertise within the oss community to showcase members skills or expertise 

How i did it
Assigned roles to designers, engineers and PMs 
Also created some channels for Q and As, Resources and Updates etc
